I am an absolute fan of adapting your work environment to your needs. Spending an hour to set up some shortcuts is virtually always a good time investment.

Then you can easily drag your most used commands into a new bar. You should be able to save a lot of time on, e.g. aligning objects in PowerPoint or sorting and filtering data in Excel. It is entirely up to you and the operations you use the most. 

PowerPoint:

Excel:

Here are the two files that contain my current setup for PowerPoint and Excel:

* [Powerpoint-Ribbon](/files/office_ribbons/Powerpoint-Ribbon.exportedUI)
* [Excel-Ribbon](/files/office_ribbons/Excel-Ribbon.exportedUI)

You can easily import like this:
