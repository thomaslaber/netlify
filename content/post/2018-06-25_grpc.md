## Instructions

[Link to instructions](https://github.com/nfultz/grpc/blob/master/install)

{{< highlight bash >}}
git clone https://github.com/grpc/grpc.git grpc.git
cd grpc.git/
# git checkout tags/release-0_11_1 # does not exist
{{< /highlight >}}

Now we have to initialize the submodules and this is where it becomes tricky:

{{< highlight bash >}}
git submodule update --init
cd third_party/protobuf/
./autogen.sh 
{{< /highlight >}}

Google changed some of its internal structures and now gmock is part of google test. Anyways, the URL in the autpgen.sh is not working anymore. There we need to manually extract **gmock** into **protobuf**:

[gmock.zip](/files/grpc/gmock.zip)

There is another change in the 

{{< highlight bash >}}
./configure
make -j8
sudo make install 
# sudo ldconfig # this command does not exist on a mac, so we simply skip it. Otherwise it would update all dependencies.
cd - # brings us back to the root folder
make -j8
sudo make install
{{< /highlight >}}

This last command should fail us again. We get an error message similar to this: 
```
In file included from include/grpc++/channel.h:37:
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1/memory:2285:5: error: delete called on 'grpc::CallOpGenericRecvMessageHelper::DeserializeFunc' that is abstract but has non-virtual destructor
      [-Werror,-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor]
    delete __ptr;
    ^
```

We need to add the following line, i.e. a `virtual deconstructor` at line 273 in class `CallOpGenericRecvMessageHelper` in file `include/grpc++/impl/call.h`: 
```	
virtual ~DeserializeFunc() {}
```

Again, you can download the file here: 

[call.h](/files/grpc/call.h)

After this we continue with the procedure: 

{{< highlight bash >}}	
# sudo ldconfig

R CMD INSTALL grpc
R -e "grpc::grpc_version()"
{{< /highlight >}}
