## 1. What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. A framework in which complex adaptive problems can be addressed. It is lightweight, simple to understand and yet difficult to master.
To simplify, Scrum is not a process or a technique – it is a framework within which you can use different processes and techniques.
It has roles, events, artefacts and rules that bind them together. Each component has a specific purpose. Scrum takes an iterative and incremental approach – optimizing predictability and control risk.

    Scrum has its foundation based on the empirical process theory – where knowledge comes from experience and decisions are made based on what is known.

    There are three pillars that uphold every implementation of empirical process control.
    - Transparency
    - Inspection
    - Adaptation

The five core values that are reflective in the work of a Scrum Team.

### 1.1. Scrum Values

- People personally commit to achieving the goal of the Scrum team.
- Scrum member have the Courage to do the right thing.
- Everyone’s focus is on the sprint and Scrum team goals.
- Everyone agrees to be Open about all the work and challenges.
- Scrum team members Respect each other of being capable and independent.

## 2. Scrum Team

A self-organised and cross functional team – designed to optimize flexibility, creativity and productivity.

    </td>

  <tr>
      <td>Development Team</td>
        <td>
     <ul>
        <li>Self-organised and accountable</li>
        <li>No one tells the development team how to turn the backlog item into increments of realisable product.</li>
        <li>Cross functional team with all skills to create a product increment.</li>

    </td>
    <td>
     <ul>
        <li>Development team shouldn’t act on anyone else’s request.</li>

        <li>Everyone’s title is Developer and there shouldn’t be any sub teams.</li>
        <li>No one can instruct development team to work on different set of requirements.</li>
        <li>The number of items from the backlog for the sprint is solely up to the development team.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table> 


## 3. Scrum Events

    All events in Scrum are time boxed.
    Sprint duration cannot change once it’s started. However, it can be cancelled before the time box is over. Only a Product Owner can cancel a Sprint, If the organisation changes direction or the market or the technology conditions change.
    Events enable transparency and create an opportunity to inspect and adapt.

The Sprint is the heart of Scrum, a time box of one month or less during which a DONE, usable, and potential releasable product increment is created.

 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
	<th>Events</th>
	<th>Time box*</th>
	<th>Agenda</th>
	<th>Required</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sprint Planning</td>

</ul></td>
<td>The Scrum Team</td>
  </tr>
</table>

*Time box mentioned above is for one month sprint. For short sprint, it’s usually shorter. Scrum Activities - Backlog refining or grooming

This is an on-going activity and should not take more than 10 % of the development team’s time where product backlogs are groomed or refined.
The product owner is responsible for prioritizing the product backlog items and the development team is responsible for estimating them.

### 4. Scrum Artefacts

    Scrum’s artefacts reflect the three pillars of the Empirical Theory Process in the work or value to increase transparency and opportunities for inspection and an enhanced scope for adaptation.
    
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<th>Artefact</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Owner</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Product Backlog</td>
<td><ul>
	<li>Product backlog is an ordered list of everything that’s needed to complete a product. It is the single source of a living list of requirement.</li>
	<li>Product owner is responsible to maintain and prioritize the backlog items.</li>
	<li>Product backlog is dynamic and never complete.</li>
	<li>Sprint can start as soon as there are enough items in the backlog.</li>
	<li>There is always only one product backlog.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>Product Owner</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sprint Backlog</td>
<td><ul>
	<li>Product backlog is an ordered list of everything that’s needed to complete a product. It is the single source of a living list of requirement.</li>
	<li>Product owner is responsible to maintain and prioritize the backlog items.</li>
	<li>Product backlog is dynamic and never complete.</li>
	<li>Sprint can start as soon as there are enough items in the backlog.</li>
	<li>There is always only one product backlog.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>Development Team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Increment
</td>
<td><ul>
	<li>An Increment is a sum of all completed product backlog items and the items of the increments of all previous sprints.</li>
</ul>
e.g.<br />
Increment 1 = Sprint 1 Increment 2 = Sprint 1 + Sprint 2<br />
Increment 3 = Sprint 1 + Sprint 2 + Sprint 3.</td>
<td>Development Team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monitoring progress towards a Goal (delivering the product)</td>
<td><ul>
	<li>The total work remaining to reach the goal can be summed.</li>
	<li>The product owner compares the amount of work remaining against the previous sprint reviews to assess the progress.</li>
</ul>Most commonly used techniques are burn-downs and burn-ups charts.</td>
<td>Product Owner</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monitoring Sprint Progress</td>
<td><ul>
	<li>The sum of remaining work to deliver an increment which is reviewed at the daily scrum.</li>
	<li>The sprint progress information can be represented by a burn-down chart.</li>

</ul></td>
<td>Development Team</td>
</tr>
</table> 
    
### 5. Progress Tracking Tools

Burndown charts: Burn-down chart shows the progress the development team is making and is a powerful tool for visualising progress and work remaining. Burn-down charts may be used for financial tracking, resource tracking etc. In respect to a sprint, a burn down chart is represented as -

1. Vertical Axis – Remaining work (total estimated hours) for the sprint or product backlog
2. Horizontal Axis – Time, in days or sprints

A burn-down chart enables everyone to view the status of a sprint at any time.

### 6. Estimation Techniques

There are number of estimation techniques used in Agile. Most widely used in planning is the poker technique to estimate items.
Participants use cards to estimate an item. This exercise is repeated in iterations until everyone’s estimates are unanimous.
Units used are Hours, days or story points. Other techniques in practice are:

1. The Bucket System
2. Big/Uncertain/Small
3. Dot voting
4. T-Shirt sizes
5. Affinity Mapping and more.

### 7. Definitions

<dl>
<dt>Done</dt>
<dd>
A product backlog item or an increment that is releasable is called DONE. Everyone in the Scrum team should have common understanding of DONE.<br />
DONE should include all the development practices before the item is released into Production.
</dd>
<dt>Velocity</dt>
<dd>Average of items done per Sprint to deliver a product.
<br />
e.g. It took 5 sprints to deliver a product.
<br /><br />
Sprint1 - 10 Units<br />
Sprint2 - 12 Units<br />
Sprint3 - 9 Units<br />
Sprint4 - 11 Units<br />
Sprint5 – 13 Units<br /><br />

Velocity = (10 + 12 + 9 + 11 + 13)/5 = 11<br />

Velocity of the team in this example is 11 units per Sprint.
</dd>

<dt>Time box</dt>
<dd>Fixed time-period, it is an agreed previous agreed duration which the team has been consistently delivering a task or completing a goal.</dd>
<dt>Sprint Goal</dt>
<dd>Description of what the development team agrees to achieve in a sprint.</dd>
</dl>
