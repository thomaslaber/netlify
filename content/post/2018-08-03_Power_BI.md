## Columns vs Measures

Calculated columns (and tables) are:

- Evaluated for each row in your table, immediately after you hit 'Enter' to complete the formula
- Saved back into the model so take up space

Calculated Measures are:

- Evaluated when you use it in a visual, when the visual is rendered
- Not saved anywhere (well, actually there's a cache in the report layer but it's not part of the file when you hit Save)

Generally, measures are more useful, but the trade-offs are the performance hit (report runtime vs. pre-processed), storage space, and the type of expressions you can use. For example calculated columns are often used when you want to filter on the result rather than just as a calculated result.
