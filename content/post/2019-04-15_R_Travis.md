In this post we will explore how to set up R package development on github focusing on implementing an automatic Travis and codecoverage check. 

I set up a sample repo that will include a very basic configuration: [TravisR](https://github.com/thomaslaber/TravisR)

# Travis

[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) is a great
You can easily sign up by connecting your github account:

You will need to select the repository want to have checked and save this in a file called `travis.yml`:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
# R for travis: see documentation at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r

language: R
sudo: false
cache: packages

r_packages:
  - covr
  - devtools

after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'library(covr); codecov()'

# safelist
branches:
  only:
  - master
  - development
{{< /highlight >}} 

As you can see I already added the covr support. This is what a succesful Travis build looks like:

# codecov

[codecov](https://codecov.io/) is a tool to "group, merge, archive, and compare coverage reports." It is free for open source. 

Again we can easily sign up or sign in by using our github account. This method has the great advantage of directly being able to choose the repository we want to have checked.

In order to get the cool badges add this to your `READ.ME`:
{{< highlight markdown >}}
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thomaslaber/TravisR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thomaslaber/TravisR)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/thomaslaber/TravisR/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/thomaslaber/TravisR)
{{< /highlight >}} 

This is what the final result looks like:
