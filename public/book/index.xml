      <description>The Divided Self Human thinking depends on metaphor. We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think about life in general, but once you apply the metaphor &amp;ldquo;life is a journey,&amp;rdquo; the metaphor guides you to some conclusions: You should learn the terrain, pick a direction, find some good traveling companions, and enjoy the trip, because there may be nothing at the end of the road.</description>

Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s 2012 book So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You is a career strategy book designed around four ideas.
 The first idea is that &amp;lsquo;follow your passion&amp;rsquo; is terrible career advice, and people who say this should be shot don&amp;rsquo;t know what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about. Cal Newport calls this idea of following your passion &amp;lsquo;the passion hypothesis&amp;rsquo;.
 The second idea is that instead of believing in the passion hypothesis, you should adopt what Newport calls the &amp;lsquo;craftsman mindset&amp;rsquo;.</description>
