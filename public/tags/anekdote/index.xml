      <description>Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law Probably one of the most famous of all laws, mostly because it is not only applicable to Software Development.
If something can go wrong, it will.  First derivation: If it works, you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t write it. Second derivation: Cursing is the only language all programmers speak fluently. Conclusion: A computer will do what you write, not what you want.
Defensive programming, version control, doom scenario&amp;rsquo;s (for those damned zombie-server-attacks), TDD, MDD, etc.</description>

      <title>The Happiness Hypothesis</title>

      <description>The Divided Self Human thinking depends on metaphor. We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think about life in general, but once you apply the metaphor &amp;ldquo;life is a journey,&amp;rdquo; the metaphor guides you to some conclusions: You should learn the terrain, pick a direction, find some good traveling companions, and enjoy the trip, because there may be nothing at the end of the road.</description>

      <description>The best article I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read about architecture and the management of IT.
UPDATE
This post was intended to be shared privately and was accidentally made public. Thanks to +Steve Yegge for allowing us to keep it out there. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of writing people do when they think nobody is watching: honest, clear, and frank.
The world would be a better place if more people wrote this sort of internal memoranda, and even better if they were allowed to write it for the outside world.</description>
