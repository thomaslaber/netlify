      <description>Columns vs Measures Calculated columns (and tables) are:
 Evaluated for each row in your table, immediately after you hit &amp;lsquo;Enter&amp;rsquo; to complete the formula Saved back into the model so take up space  Calculated Measures are:
 Evaluated when you use it in a visual, when the visual is rendered Not saved anywhere (well, actually there&amp;rsquo;s a cache in the report layer but it&amp;rsquo;s not part of the file when you hit Save)  Generally, measures are more useful, but the trade-offs are the performance hit (report runtime vs.</description>

1. What is Scrum? Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. A framework in which complex adaptive problems can be addressed. It is lightweight, simple to understand and yet difficult to master. To simplify, Scrum is not a process or a technique - it is a framework within which you can use different processes and techniques. It has roles, events, artefacts and rules that bind them together.</description>

      <description>Here is a great tutorial on how to host hugo on netlify
Create hugo site In order to create a new hugo site simply go:
hugo new site [path] [flags] git Create a new repository on the command line Init the git repo and push it to the guthub repo:
echo &amp;#34;# website2&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; README.mdgit initgit add README.mdgit commit -m &amp;#34;first commit&amp;#34;git remote add origin https://github.</description>

It is used to estimate real values (cost of houses, number of calls, total sales etc.) based on continuous variable(s). Here, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best line. This best fit line is known as regression line and represented by a linear equation
$$Y= a *X + b$$
The best way to understand linear regression is to relive this experience of childhood.</description>

      <description>Don’t get confused by its name! It is a classification not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values (binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on given set of independent variable(s). In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).</description>

      <description>Broadly, there are three types of Machine Learning Algorithms..
1. Supervised Learning How it works: This algorithm consist of a target or outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.</description>

      <description>The Divided Self Human thinking depends on metaphor. We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think about life in general, but once you apply the metaphor &amp;ldquo;life is a journey,&amp;rdquo; the metaphor guides you to some conclusions: You should learn the terrain, pick a direction, find some good traveling companions, and enjoy the trip, because there may be nothing at the end of the road.</description>

      <description>Many organizations have become adept at identifying what they need from software development projects, based on a keen understanding of their business goals. Even so, they’re often surprised to find out that the end results don’t achieve the transformative impact they were expecting. Their mistake? Overlooking the importance of Conway’s Law.
In 1967, Melvin Conway coined a phrase at the end of his publication ‘How do committees invent?’ that was subsequently made popular by Fred Brooks in his book The Mythical Man-Month, where he dubbed it &amp;lsquo;Conway’s Law&amp;rsquo;, which states:</description>
