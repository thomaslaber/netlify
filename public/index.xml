      <description>Here is a great tutorial on how to host hugo on netlify
Create hugo site In order to create a new hugo site simply go:
hugo new site [path] [flags] git Create a new repository on the command line Init the git repo and push it to the guthub repo:
echo &amp;#34;# website2&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; README.md git init git add README.md git commit -m &amp;#34;first commit&amp;#34; git remote add origin https://github.</description>

      <description>The best article I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read about architecture and the management of IT.
UPDATE
This post was intended to be shared privately and was accidentally made public. Thanks to +Steve Yegge for allowing us to keep it out there. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of writing people do when they think nobody is watching: honest, clear, and frank.
The world would be a better place if more people wrote this sort of internal memoranda, and even better if they were allowed to write it for the outside world.</description>

      <description>The Divided Self Human thinking depends on metaphor. We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think about life in general, but once you apply the metaphor &amp;ldquo;life is a journey,&amp;rdquo; the metaphor guides you to some conclusions: You should learn the terrain, pick a direction, find some good traveling companions, and enjoy the trip, because there may be nothing at the end of the road.</description>

      <title>So Good They Can&#39;t Ignore You</title>

Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s 2012 book So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You is a career strategy book designed around four ideas.
 The first idea is that &amp;lsquo;follow your passion&amp;rsquo; is terrible career advice, and people who say this should be shot don&amp;rsquo;t know what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about. Cal Newport calls this idea of following your passion &amp;lsquo;the passion hypothesis&amp;rsquo;.
 The second idea is that instead of believing in the passion hypothesis, you should adopt what Newport calls the &amp;lsquo;craftsman mindset&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>In a Field Notes post from 2014, LeadingAgile consultant Andrew Fuqua considers Brooks’ Law in the context of the Theory of Constraints.
 Brooks’ Law is the adage that adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
 Fuqua notes that Brooks observed people “and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.”
Effective communication is key to any project.</description>

      <description>A groundbreaking partnership with a new vision for renewable data and intelligent applications Digital transformation is how you compete and win today. It’s the path to better serve customers, build better products, and empower employees. And it&amp;rsquo;s data that is the foundational resource that allows you to transform and uncover the insights you need to drive business forward.
Adobe, Microsoft, and SAP are partnering on the Open Data Initiative to enable data to be exchanged—and enriched—across systems, making it a renewable resource that flows into intelligent applications.</description>

It is used to estimate real values (cost of houses, number of calls, total sales etc.) based on continuous variable(s). Here, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best line. This best fit line is known as regression line and represented by a linear equation
$$Y= a *X + b$$
The best way to understand linear regression is to relive this experience of childhood.</description>

      <description>Don’t get confused by its name! It is a classification not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values (binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on given set of independent variable(s). In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).</description>

      <description>Broadly, there are three types of Machine Learning Algorithms..
1. Supervised Learning How it works: This algorithm consist of a target or outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.</description>

      <description>Many organizations have become adept at identifying what they need from software development projects, based on a keen understanding of their business goals. Even so, they’re often surprised to find out that the end results don’t achieve the transformative impact they were expecting. Their mistake? Overlooking the importance of Conway’s Law.
In 1967, Melvin Conway coined a phrase at the end of his publication ‘How do committees invent?’ that was subsequently made popular by Fred Brooks in his book The Mythical Man-Month, where he dubbed it &amp;lsquo;Conway’s Law&amp;rsquo;, which states:</description>
